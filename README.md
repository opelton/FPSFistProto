FPSFistProto is a simple FPS hand prototyped in Unity Engine, built on top of the FPS template project.

The hand is meant to expand the standard FPS prop-grab, by adding a visual presence, a barehanded attack, and more options when holding an item. Going forward, I would try to simplify the experience by reducing the hand's features, or limiting/removing the player's gun.

Playable webGL build of the prototype is available here: https://simmer.io/@namespaceKam/fps-proto-sandbox


Controls (barehanded):

F - Punch

E - Grab/Use


Controls (Holding):

E - Use held item

F - Swing held item

G - Throw held item


Items:

Health Potion - Heals the one who uses it. Can also be smashed on the ground for a weaker area heal

Keycard/Lock - Use keycard to ping the lock it corresponds to, and unlocks it when nearby

Shield - Blocks bullets when held and used

Tiny Cube - Simplest possible held item, basically just a rock with no special on-use actions

Sword - Basically just a longer, cooling looking rock. I was learning blender and I like swords. 

Buttons - Can be pressed, punched, shot, or struck with a thrown item

Vending Machine - Press for an item, currently only health potions
